# [Zoop](http://zoopapp.com/)
**Zoop** is a web application that enables users to conveniently order food by scanning a QR code. The platform was designed with a strong focus on user experience, performance, and scalability. Built using React, Redux, Thunk, and Material UI, it features reusable components and server-side rendering via Next.js, ensuring a smooth and responsive interface with enhanced SEO performance. The app also includes Progressive Web App (PWA) support for offline access and fast loading times, along with Razorpay payment integration for secure transactions. Additionally, the implementation of lazy loading, infinite scrolling, and a well-architected cart system optimized both the performance and the shopping experience.

I played a key role in architecting the project, building the frontend, managing back-end communication, and deploying the app to AWS EC2. The dynamic nature of the app allowed for different meta-information on various product pages, improving SEO and user engagement. This project showcases a solid combination of modern web technologies and best practices to deliver a high-performing and user-friendly application.
