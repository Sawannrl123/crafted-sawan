# [Pocket FM](https://pocketfm.com/)
During my tenure at **PocketFM**, I have played a pivotal role in optimizing and enhancing multiple projects, including the Newsroom, Ghostwriter, and PocketFM applications. By implementing performance optimizations, reducing bundle sizes significantly, and enhancing user experience, I improved the overall efficiency and responsiveness of our platforms. As a team lead, I focused on mentoring junior developers, fostering a collaborative environment, and instituting effective processes for project management and code quality.

I successfully migrated components to TypeScript, integrated modern technologies like Tailwind and Shadcn, and introduced structured coding practices, which collectively enhanced code maintainability and robustness. My commitment to team well-being and professional development included initiating regular retrospectives and fun meetings to improve morale.

Through strategic improvements, cross-team collaboration, and a focus on user-centered design, I have contributed to creating accessible, high-performing applications that deliver value to our users while fostering a culture of continuous learning and improvement within the team.
