# [Pocket FM](https://pocketfm.com/)
During my tenure at **PocketFM**, I have played a pivotal role in optimizing and enhancing multiple projects, including the Newsroom, Ghostwriter, and PocketFM applications. By implementing performance optimizations, reducing bundle sizes significantly, and enhancing user experience, I improved the overall efficiency and responsiveness of our platforms. As a team lead, I focused on mentoring junior developers, fostering a collaborative environment, and instituting effective processes for project management and code quality.

I successfully migrated components to TypeScript, integrated modern technologies like Tailwind and Shadcn, and introduced structured coding practices, which collectively enhanced code maintainability and robustness. My commitment to team well-being and professional development included initiating regular retrospectives and fun meetings to improve morale.

Through strategic improvements, cross-team collaboration, and a focus on user-centered design, I have contributed to creating accessible, high-performing applications that deliver value to our users while fostering a culture of continuous learning and improvement within the team.

## Work Highlights
- **Code Optimization:** Identified redundant and non-standard code, breaking large components into smaller, manageable ones for easier testing. Achieved a 25% improvement in code efficiency.
- **Modular Website Revamp:** Revamped website modules to ensure that development could continue smoothly without bottlenecks, improving the overall development process.
- **Lighthouse Score Improvement:** Enhanced the websiteâ€™s Lighthouse score from 50% to 80%, with continuous efforts to further optimize performance.
- **Performance Enhancement:** Improved page performance by implementing caching using React-Query and service workers, reducing API load by 50%.
- **Test Coverage and Code Quality:** Maintained a minimum code coverage of 80% through unit and integration tests, reducing production errors by 12%. Integrated Husky to ensure tests run before commits and SonarQube to block PR merges below 80% coverage for changed files.
- **Production Error Tracking:** Introduced Sentry for tracking production errors, decreasing production issues by 20% and streamlining the resolution process.
- **TypeScript Migration:** Migrated the codebase to TypeScript for improved type safety and prevention of runtime errors, increasing productivity and code quality by 15%.
- **Tailwind & Shadcn Implementation:** Standardized the UI by integrating Tailwind and Shadcn, reducing duplicate CSS, improving development speed, and reducing bundle size by 10%. This also led to increased accessibility and SEO performance.
- **Architecture Design:** Architected four scalable projects from scratch, ensuring long-term sustainability and capability to scale efficiently.
- **Team Leadership:** Led a team of 10 members, handling requirements gathering, one-on-one discussions, goal setting, and aggressive PR reviews.
- **Player Experience Improvement:** Improved user experience by optimizing transitions between mini and full video/audio players, using a single instance to reduce bandwidth usage by 13%.
