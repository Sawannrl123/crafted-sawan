# [Olx](https://www.olx.in/)
At **OLX Autos**, I played a pivotal role as both a developer and team lead, overseeing a five-member team while enhancing my management skills. I contributed to the platformâ€™s success in facilitating vehicle transactions by implementing key features, including an improved map page that boosted user address visibility by 23%, and a one-page checkout system that streamlined the booking process, leading to a 15% efficiency increase.

I also introduced real-time tracking for bookings using WebSocket technology, enabling seamless user experiences. My efforts in redesigning the lead-to-quote journey resulted in an 18% increase in quote generation, while a self-inspection module contributed to an 8% growth in bookings.

In addition to technical contributions, I migrated our component library to TypeScript, enhancing maintainability. I conducted a TypeScript training session for 50 team members, featuring live demonstrations to improve overall proficiency.

My commitment to software reliability included implementing integration tests with Cypress and managing dynamic page layouts for various campaigns. I also prioritized security by upgrading outdated packages. Through these initiatives, I significantly improved user experience and operational efficiency, solidifying OLX Autos as a leading platform in the vehicle sales market.
