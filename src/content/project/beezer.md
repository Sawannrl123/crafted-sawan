# [Beezer](https://www.beezer.com/)
At **Beezer**, I played a crucial role in developing a platform that empowers users to create custom progressive web apps for Android and iOS. I focused on building reusable components with **React** and **Redux**, while ensuring seamless integration with back-end services through **REST APIs** and **WebSockets**.

I successfully executed CRUD operations using **Firebase** and enhanced database management through custom scripts. My contributions included implementing a user-friendly PWA installation dialogue, which increased user acquisition by 4%, and integrating a role-based account module for improved user management.

Additionally, I prioritized code quality by writing unit tests with **Jest** and **Chai**, and I managed code changes effectively using **Git**. Throughout the project, I collaborated closely with my team, utilizing **Slack** for communication and updates, ensuring a smooth and efficient development process.

## Work Highlights
- **Component Development:** Built over 10 reusable components using React, Redux, Material UI, and Styled Components, enhancing modularity and efficiency in application development.
- **Back-End Integration:** Managed back-end communication through REST APIs and WebSockets, ensuring seamless data flow between front-end and back-end systems.
- **Server-Side Development:** Wrote server-side code using Node.js, facilitating robust server operations and functionality.
- **Database Management:** Executed CRUD operations using Firebase, and developed a shell script for efficient deletion and dumping of the Firebase database, streamlining maintenance tasks.
