# [Bed Bath & Beyond](https://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/)
At **Bed Bath & Beyond**, I played a key role in enhancing their e-commerce platform, delivering robust and scalable front-end solutions using **JavaScript**, **React**, and **Next.js**. I successfully migrated the application to Next.js, improving performance and scalability while managing multi-theme support across regions. I also integrated real-time data communication through **REST APIs** and **WebSockets**, ensuring a dynamic user experience.

In addition to resolving bugs, I boosted test coverage from 70% to 90%, ensuring the reliability and quality of the codebase. I actively contributed to code reviews, collaborated with cross-functional teams, and used tools like **JIRA**, **GitHub**, and **Jenkins** to streamline the development process. My work ensured the platform remained fast, responsive, and tailored to users across the US, Canada, and Mexico.

## Work Highlights
- **Front-End Development:** Implemented reusable UI components using JavaScript, React, PostCSS, and Next.js to enhance the user interface and user experience across multiple regions.
- **Migration to Next.js:** Successfully migrated the React-based application to Next.js, improving overall performance, scalability, and server-side rendering capabilities.
- **Multi-Theme Support:** Managed and maintained themes for different regions (US, Canada, Mexico) within a single codebase, ensuring smooth regional customization.
- **Back-End Communication:** Integrated front-end with back-end systems through REST APIs and WebSockets for real-time communication and data handling.
- **Bug Resolution & Code Management:** Utilized JIRA for tracking and resolving bugs, ensuring timely fixes and optimizations. Managed code using GitHub, including raising merge requests and addressing code review comments.
- **Test Code Coverage:** Improved the platformâ€™s test code coverage from 70% to 90% using tools like Enzyme and Sinon, ensuring reliable and robust code.
- **Code Reviews:** Actively participated in code reviews to maintain high standards of code quality and collaboration within the development team.
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Used Quantum Matrix and Sumo Logic for real-time monitoring, logging, and analytics to optimize platform performance and address issues proactively.
- **Collaboration & Teamwork:** Collaborated with cross-functional teams, managed version control with GitHub, and worked with continuous integration tools like Jenkins.
