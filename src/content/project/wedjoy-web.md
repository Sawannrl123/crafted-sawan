# [Wedjoy Website](https://www.mywedjoy.com/)
The WedJoy Website is an Angular-based application designed to showcase uploaded wedding content, offering users a dynamic and engaging experience. My role involved finalizing project requirements and developing a user-friendly interface using Angular 2+, HTML, and SCSS. I successfully implemented a multi-theme approach, allowing for customizable user experiences based on API responses.

The project included robust back-end communication via REST APIs and WebSockets, ensuring seamless data integration. I focused on enhancing performance by utilizing server-side rendering (SSR) and optimizing asset management, which reduced page load times and improved user interaction by 20%. Key features such as infinite scrolling and real-time functionalities—like likes and multi-comments—further enriched the user experience.

Throughout the development process, I managed bug resolution via Trello and employed Git for effective version control. This project exemplifies my ability to create scalable web applications with a strong emphasis on user experience and performance optimization.

## Work Highlights
- **UI Development:** Designed and implemented the user interface using Angular 2+, HTML, and SCSS, focusing on usability and aesthetics.
- **Multi-Theme Implementation:** Developed a multi-theme approach, allowing dynamic theme changes based on API responses.
- **Back-End Integration:** Managed back-end communication through REST APIs and WebSockets to ensure seamless data flow.
- **Bug Resolution:** Actively resolved bugs and issues tracked on Trello, contributing to ongoing improvements.
- **Version Control:** Managed code using Git to maintain project integrity and facilitate collaboration.
- **Architectural Design:** Developed the application from scratch with server-side rendering (SSR), optimizing for performance and scalability.
- **Performance Optimization:** Utilized JIT compilation to reduce build time by 1 minute and decrease bundle size by 10MB.
- **Asset Management:** Implemented parallel image and video uploads with asset optimization, including error handling and retry mechanisms.
- **User Experience Enhancement:** Introduced infinite scroll for the image feed, reducing page load time by 50% and improving user interaction by 20%.
- **Real-Time Features:** Integrated real-time capabilities such as likes, multi-comments, and synchronous sharing to enhance engagement.
