# [GiveClub](https://www.giveclub.com/)
At **Kyynd**, I served as the sole frontend developer on a dynamic team dedicated to enhancing a CS-Cart based platform for charitable donations over a two-year period. My primary responsibilities included developing user interfaces with HTML and LESS, ensuring a consistent and responsive design that improved user experience. I effectively managed view and layout configurations through the admin panel and resolved bugs tracked on Trello, ensuring timely updates and enhancements.

Utilizing Git for version control allowed me to maintain efficient code management while creating and integrating emailers for effective newsletter communication. To optimize performance, I split the main CSS bundle into multiple chunks for faster loading times and developed custom modules like product cards, image sliders, and accordions, enhancing the platformâ€™s functionality.

Additionally, I implemented versioning strategies for JavaScript and CSS files to ensure proper deployment of updates, and my modifications to the default theme resulted in a notable 40% increase in user engagement. This experience honed my skills in frontend development while contributing to a meaningful cause.
